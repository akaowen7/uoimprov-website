# uOttawa English Improv Club's Website

Made with love with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and Tailwind. 

It's a general information site for our club, for us to link our socials, post announcements, and advertise shows.

## Hi I'm a future club exec what is this
oh hi. sorry. I hope you have some background in web dev otherwise this will be a little difficult. [look here for more info](MAINTAING.md)

## Nerd Shit
IMO This is a perfect use case for Astro (well I think basically anything is a perfect use case for Astro but..) as its as of now all plain, non interactive html. Astro's built in templating is great (I like EJS and this is very similar) and I anticipate the Markdown integration to be very useful
