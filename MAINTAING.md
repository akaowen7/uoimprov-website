# How is this website held together.
Ok I must assume you have some basic web dev knowledge, if you do not and don't think you can work on this, then I just suggest you scrap this website and make a wix website or something. No shade, I knew this day would come.

This site is built with Astro, [here is the docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/). Its basically an all in one framework that focuses on "pre-rendered" static HTML but has extensive capability to include interactive client side components. As of right now there are none of these in this site. 

The file structure should be pretty self evident.
